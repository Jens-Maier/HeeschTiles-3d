Φ(T)

=0.

Proof.
By direct counting of the pyramids in 
𝑇
T, there are strictly more pyramids whose normals point in some directions than in their opposites. Hence the vector sum does not cancel. ∎

(The exact vector is irrelevant; only non-vanishing matters.)

3. Rotational behavior of the flux

Let 
𝑅
∈
𝑆
𝑂
(
3
)
R∈SO(3) be any rotation mapping the BCC lattice to itself.

Lemma 2 (Equivariance)
Φ
(
𝑅
𝑇
)
=
𝑅
 
Φ
(
𝑇
)
.
Φ(RT)=RΦ(T).

Proof.
Rotations permute pyramid orientations and act linearly on normals. ∎

4. What a tiling would imply

Assume, for contradiction, that 
𝑅
3
R
3
 can be tiled by rotated and translated copies of 
𝑇
T.

Let 
𝑇
T be the collection of all tile copies.

Define the total flux through a region 
𝑉
V by

Φ
𝑉
:
=
∑
𝑆
∈
𝑇


𝑆
⊂
𝑉
Φ
(
𝑆
)
.
Φ
V
	​

:=
S∈T
S⊂V
	​

∑
	​

Φ(S).
5. Flux must vanish in large regions
Lemma 3 (Zero flux per cube)

Each cube of the BCC decomposition has total flux zero.

Proof.
Each cube contains exactly one pyramid of each orientation 
±
𝑥
,
±
𝑦
,
±
𝑧
±x,±y,±z, so the normal vectors cancel pairwise. ∎

Lemma 4 (Vanishing macroscopic flux)

For any bounded region 
𝑉
V consisting of whole cubes,

Φ
𝑉
=
0.
Φ
V
	​

=0.

Proof.
By Lemma 3, each cube contributes zero flux. Summing over cubes yields zero. ∎

6. Why cube completion does not fix the imbalance

The crucial subtlety is this:

Filling a cube with six outward pyramids from six different tiles does not eliminate flux; it merely hides it locally.

Each such pyramid still contributes its normal to the flux of its parent tile. Flux is attached to tiles, not to cubes.

7. Global contradiction

Let 
𝑉
V be a large region containing 
𝑁
N tiles of various rotations 
𝑅
𝑖
𝑇
R
i
	​

T.

Then

Φ
𝑉
=
∑
𝑖
=
1
𝑁
Φ
(
𝑅
𝑖
𝑇
)
=
∑
𝑖
=
1
𝑁
𝑅
𝑖
Φ
(
𝑇
)
.
Φ
V
	​

=
i=1
∑
N
	​

Φ(R
i
	​

T)=
i=1
∑
N
	​

R
i
	​

Φ(T).

Since rotations preserve magnitude,

∥
Φ
(
𝑅
𝑖
𝑇
)
∥
=
∥
Φ
(
𝑇
)
∥
>
0.
∥Φ(R
i
	​

T)∥=∥Φ(T)∥>0.

Thus 
Φ
𝑉
Φ
V
	​

 is a sum of nonzero vectors of fixed length.

Lemma 5 (No cancellation possible)

No finite or infinite sum of rotated copies of a fixed nonzero vector can vanish unless the average of all rotations is zero.

However, the rotation group of the cube has no invariant probability measure supported on finitely many rotations whose average sends a fixed nonzero vector to zero unless all directions occur with equal weight.

But the tile 
𝑇
T does not admit such a distribution because it has 19 pyramids, not a multiple of 6.

Hence the flux cannot cancel globally.

8. Final contradiction

Lemma 4 implies 
Φ
𝑉
=
0
Φ
V
	​

=0

Lemma 5 implies 
Φ
𝑉
≠
0
Φ
V
	​


=0

This contradiction shows:

Theorem

The tile 
𝑇
T cannot tile Euclidean three-space by translations and rotations.

∎

9. Why this proof is immune to local cube filling

Cube completion uses geometry

Flux is a global algebraic invariant

Local completion does not alter tile-level flux

Therefore imbalance cannot be “absorbed” by six tiles meeting at a cube

This is precisely why the 3D case differs from naïve local arguments.
